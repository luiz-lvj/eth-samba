# Fuel.snap

Our solution consists of a Metamask Snap, which is a tool on Metamask to create new and experimental features. Fuel.snap is a solution to escalete Fuel, a L-2 blockchain, non-EVM but with a lot of possibilities to become one of the fastest chains alive. We believe that making Fuel live on Metamask will make users feel more excited to use it.

To install the dependencies, you need to run `yarn install` and then `yarn workspace snap start & yarn workspace site start` to run the website.
